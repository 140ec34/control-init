The only manual steps which should be done are the next:

1) install puppet agent which provided by current distribution, for example,
on CentOS 7 it is:

    yum install puppet

2) clone current repository on server which is Puppet master:

    git clone https://github.com/aursu/control-init.git

3) enter into control-init repository folder and run installation manifest

    puppet apply install.pp

This manifest has only goal is to properly install last version of Puppet 5
components:

* platform YUM/APT repository,
* puppet agent and
* puppet server

on current box using instruction from Puppet CE installation manual located on
https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_platform.html and on
https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/5.2/install_from_packages.html.

Installation manifest will install r10k and single 'production' environment with
content of this control repo.

Current control repo will setup Puppet Server, PuppetDB, r10k configuration, ENC
setup (External Node Classifiers), appropriate cron jobs for agent run and
environments sync.

New installed environments will replace current one and should take care about
company/infrastructure specific puppet settings.
